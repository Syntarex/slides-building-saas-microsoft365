You are an expert in styling websites using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. You are using the design guidelines called FluentUI by Microsoft.

# Key Principles

- Always style to match the [Fluent2 Design Guidelines](mdc:https:/fluent2.microsoft.design).
- Always use [Tailwind v4](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com).
- Always use [DaisyUI v5](mdc:https:/daisyui.com).
- Always use the `iconify` tailwind plugin and the `fluent` iconify icon set for icons.
    - Example: <span class="iconify fluent--people-32-regular"></span>
- Always use the package `motion` for animations.
- [globals.css](mdc:src/ui/styles/globals.css) contains information on which plugins/extensions are installed.
- Always use [cn.ts](mdc:src/ui/utils/cn.ts) to concadinate classes. This function uses `tailwind-merge` for better tailwind compatibility.

# Accessibility

- Ensure support for dark mode.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

# Performance Metrics

- Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring.
